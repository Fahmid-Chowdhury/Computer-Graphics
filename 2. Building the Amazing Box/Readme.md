### 2. Building the Amazing Box

Project Features: <br>
- The right button click on a mouse will generate random movable points with different colours going in any random direction diagonally within a boundary region. For instance, if a point is generated at (0,0), it can go to (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (1,1), or (1, -1), and so on. The points should be spawned where the right button click will be given in the box and the colour and direction of movement should be random. The points will continue to move in the same direction and will bounce back from the wall of the boundary.
- Pressing the “up arrow” key on the keyboard will increase the speed of all the points generated so far and pressing the “down arrow” key on the keyboard will decrease the speed.
- The left button click on a mouse will make the points blink i.e. if a point is in red, it will go background colour (here it’s black) and return to red, and this transition should take place within a second while the transition cycle goes on.
- Pressing the “Spacebar” on the keyboard should freeze all the points and none of the above functionalities will work when frozen. The same “Spacebar” should unfreeze them.
