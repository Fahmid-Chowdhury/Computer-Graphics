### 1. Building a House in Rainfall

Project Features: <br>
- A house with a raindrop using the base primitives: points, lines, or triangles.
- It has been raining unwantedly for the last few days, so letâ€™s control its direction by designing a key that will change the direction of the rain when clicked (slightly bending the rainfall). I designed this functionality such that the left arrow will gradually bend the rain to the left and the right arrow will gradually bend the rain to the right.
- Pressing 'd' and 'n' will gradually change the skin colour from dark to light simulating night to day, and the other will change it from light to dark simulating day to night respectively.
